Efficient data structure for computing Optimal Partitioning models.

Basic structure is a binary search tree, probably best to implement on
top of a C++ STL map. 

See for related work http://wcipeg.com/wiki/Convex_hull_trick#Fully_dynamic_variant

Assume data set of size d.

Assume we have a solver OP(lambda) -> segments, loss. O(d log d)

Let N be the number of elements in the data structure.

Public Methods
- getModelForPenalty(lambda): find l1<=lambda<l2 in O(log N). If
  l1==lambda then return stored segments for l1 in O(1). If stored
  segments2=segments1-1 then return segments in O(1). Otherwise run
  OP(lambda) and store result for lambda in O(1).

Private Methods
- insertModel(lambda, segments, loss): O(log N) -- useful if we have a
  bunch of pre-computed models on disk.

Application: compute the full path on the benchmark data, see if the
min error that we get from the target interval algo is the same as the
actual min error. Analyze computation time: using data structure we
should be log-linear rather than quadratic.

Application: compare O(N^2) Segment Neighborhood algo (jointseg::Fpsn)
with our algo. 1-we can do parallel eval with OP. 2- only 73% of SN
models are actually computable via OP. 3-modelSelection code is linear
time.

Parallel full path algo.

loss/complexity values for which no intermediates are selected -- how
many pops does this cause?
